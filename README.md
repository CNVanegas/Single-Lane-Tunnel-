# Single-Lane-Tunnel-
CSCI - 144 Operating Systems Project 

Purpose of this project was to provide practice in using C++ Threads, Mutex's, and Control Variables. The idea behind this project is to allow cars on opposite ends of a single lane tunnel, the opportunity to cross without causing a collision. Each car is its own thread with some being assigned to the North side and the others to the South side. The goal is to have execution fairness among the threads so that each side has their opportunity to move across the lane. The user can specify the total number of cars and how many can cross at a time from a command prompt.
